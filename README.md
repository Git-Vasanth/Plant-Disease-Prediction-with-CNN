# Plant Disease Prediction Initiative

## Project Overview
The Plant Disease Prediction Initiative focuses on developing an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately identify diseases in plants. This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders by providing a reliable tool for early disease detection, ultimately promoting healthier crops and improved yields.

## Dataset Source
The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from the [Plant Village Dataset](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset), which includes a wide variety of plant images categorized by disease type.

## Project Outline

1. **Data Extraction**
   - Gather images of plants from the Plant Village Dataset, ensuring a diverse representation of healthy and diseased specimens.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Implement techniques such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset to enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting.

3. **Data Preparation for Model Building**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to facilitate effective training and evaluation of the model.

4. **Model Building with CNN**
   - Construct a Convolutional Neural Network architecture tailored for image classification, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.

5. **Model Training**
   - Train the CNN model using the prepared dataset, optimizing hyperparameters and employing techniques such as dropout to enhance performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Assess the model’s performance on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy score of **88.11%**, indicating effective disease classification.

7. **Building a Predictive System**
   - Develop a user-friendly predictive system that allows users to upload images of plants and receive instant predictions regarding potential diseases.

8. **Deployment Using Streamlit App**
   - Deploy the predictive system as a web application using Streamlit, providing an interactive platform for users to easily access the model's predictions.

9. **Screenshots of Performance**
   - Include screenshots showcasing the model’s predictions, user interface, and overall performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of the Plant Disease Prediction Initiative.
